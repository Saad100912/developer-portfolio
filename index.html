            <h3>Professional contract killer</h3>
            <p>I am a professional contract killer. I can kill anyone if you got the money. You want the president of
                united states dead, I am here to do it for you. Or maybe you want the person who dumped you few weeks
                ago who lives in the same neighborhood dead, I can do that too. The only thing I care about is money. If
                you have the money than I am your personal assassin.</p>

            <h3>Veteran</h3>
            <p>I've doing this for like 25 years. So, I got quite some blood on my hands. And in my line of work experience comes from getting my hand dirty. As a result, I got a lot of experience and know how to kill people without causing too much trouble for my clients. You can rest in peace(I mean rest in bed or couch not literally RIP) while your money as in me, does the work.</p>

            <h3>Killing of Osama Bin Laden</h3>
            <p>Yes! You heard right! I killed Osama Bin Laden! The SEAL 6 Team didn't do anything. The US government was too worried that if they involve too many men to make this killing plan then the word might spread out and Osama might escape. So, they hired me to do the killing. But used the SEAL 6 Team name to hide my identity. So, the SEAL 6 Team is just a decoy. But as you are here and can see my portfolio then there is no harm in telling you this secret</p>

            <h3>Killing of a person you probably don't know about.</h3>
            <p>I just want to tell this story, as I said you probably don't know the person but still I am going to tell it cause I don't care if you believe me or not. So, this client wanted a person dead and contacted me. But somehow this contract got leaked and the person fled to a remote place in the Amazon forest. So, I had to hike through the rain forest for 3 days and night to get to him. I could have done it other way but I am a assassin, I keep things quite.</p>
